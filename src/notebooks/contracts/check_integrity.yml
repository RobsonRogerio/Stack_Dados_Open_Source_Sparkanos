# Author: Wallace Camargo
# Description: This set of checks ensures the integrity and validity of data in the "department" table.
# It verifies that the row count is within an expected range, checks for missing or invalid department IDs,
# ensures that there are no duplicate department IDs, and confirms that the "name" column contains exactly
# three valid entries: 'Marketing', 'Sales', and 'Gambiarra Analyst'.
